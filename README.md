### Question 1: is_balanced(expression)

Implement a function `is_balanced(expression)` that takes a string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, and determines whether the expression is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.



# Question 2: remove_duplicates(sequence)
Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates removed while maintaining the original order of elements.

# Dictionaries
# Question 3: word_frequency(sentence)
Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the sentence. Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner.
